## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


###Every Saturday morning, at the same time, a primatologist goes and sits in the forest to listen for titi monkey calls, counting the number of calls they hear in a 2 hour window from 5am to 7am. Based on previous knowledge, she believes that the mean number of calls she will hear in that time is exactly 15. Let X represent the appropriate Poisson random variable of the number of calls heard in each monitoring session.

###What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

###What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

###What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

###Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.

###Simulate 104 results from this distribution (i.e., 2 years of Saturday monitoring sessions).

###Plot the simulated results using hist() and use xlim() to set the horizontal limits to be from 0 to 30. How does your histogram compare to the shape of the probability mass function you plotted above?


``` {r}

###What is the probability that she will hear more than 8 calls during any given session?

?dpois

### I will use the poisson distribution becuase I am assuming that each titi call is independent of one another.

x<-8

###I want to find the probability of x.  I am unsure if I should use 8 or 9. 

l<-15

### l is our parameter. It is a mean of 15. 

1-ppois(q=x,lambda=l)

### Rather than count from 9 to infinity, I am going to rely on the fact that we can use the compliment by subtracting by one. 
```
```{r}
###What is the probability that she will hear no calls in a session?

dpois(0,15)

###This function will give me the probability of zero calls. 

###I know I am supposed to use 15, but I am not sure why it matters to include it.
```
```{r}
###What is the probability that she will hear exactly 3 calls in a session?

dpois(3,15)

###It would make sense if we did the same thing with zero calls, but replaced the zero with 3. 
```
```{r}
###Plot the relevant Poisson mass function over the values in range 0 ≤ x ≤ 30.
